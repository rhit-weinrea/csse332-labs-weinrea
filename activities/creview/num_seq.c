/**
 * alloc_num_seq()
 *
 * Given a struct num_seq define above, this function will create a struct on the
 * heap and create spaces on the heap and also populate the data for the
 * corresponding fields (string and array).
 *
 * The function takes two strings as input. The first is a number (passed as a
 * string) defining the starting range N. The second is the end of the range M.
 *
 * Given the input, you need to
 *  1) Create a new struct num_seq on the HEAP.
 *
 *  2) Given N and M, you need to create an int array on the HEAP that includes
 *    numbers ranging from N to M (inclusively). You can assume N is less than M.
 *    For example, if the inputs are the strings "1" and "10", the int array
 *    should be {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.
 *
 *  After creating and populating this array, you need to
 *  make the field "array" of the struct point to this new array.
 *
 *  3) You need to assign the length of the array to the field "length".
 *    Following the previous example, the length should be 9.
 *
 *  4) As the return value of this function, you need to return the address of
 *    the struct you created on the HEAP.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *  struct num_seq* test = alloc_num_seq("3", "5");
 *
 * Then:
 *  test->array will point to an int array like {3, 4, 5} on the heap;
 *  test->length will be 3;
 *
 *
 * NOTE: You need to allocate exact amount of space required for the int array
 * that the field "array" points to.
 *
 * Don't call free in this function.
 *
 * YOU MAY NOT CALL OTHER FUNCTIONS EXCEPT FOR strlen(), sizeof(), memcpy(),
 * malloc(), and strtol().
 *
